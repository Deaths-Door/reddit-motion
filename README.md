- Local file system access

## Install

## Assets Directory

This tool supports videos and audio from local and YouTube sources. To include videos and audio from local sources, place them in the assets directory. For YouTube videos, you can specify the video URL in the configuration file. The tool will automatically download the video and include it in the final video.

The `assets directory` can be a single directory or a recursive structure of directories. The tool will search the `assets directory` and its subdirectories for any videos or audio files that match the specified patterns. The patterns can be specified using the following syntax:

- `*`: Matches any character except a slash ('/').
- `**`: Matches zero or more directories.

Eg : `/media/**/*.jpg`
